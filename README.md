# Bitbucket PR Helper

Automatically creates and merges PRs in Bitbucket DC.

## Setup

Go to `Settings > Extensions > Bitbucket PR Helper`, where you can find the settings.
Note: The `App Password` could be the actual user password or, what I recommend, the HTTP Access Token, that you can create going to `Manage Account` of the Bitbucket user menu.

## Usage

There is a command `Create Bitbucket Pull Request` that will get almost all details from the current git repository and from the Settings. You will see a dropdown of the current branches to select where you want TO merge FROM the current one.

## Disclaimer

I created this Extension to help myself in the development and management of real Operational services and I want to share it, but I don't have time to desl with lots of issues or improvements. I will do my best to find time.
